Flavium is a platform for reserving different sports venues, for example, tennis courts or football stadiums. It is written on Django and works correctly. Furthermore, RESTful API has been built using the REST framework and can easily be accessed from any other application, for example, frontend built using any of the JS frameworks. At the time of the development, many different adjustments have been made to make the code as efficient and fast as possible. In some parts, you might find complex logic used in order to add as much functionality as possible without hurting its time complexity. Many of the features have already been implemented and it only needs the frontend side to be considered as the MVP of the startup :)
